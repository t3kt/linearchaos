linearchaos
===========

Linearchaos is a series of visual performance systems, built with TouchDesigner.
It has gone through several iterations:
+ SomeStuff is the original, which grew out of my first experiments with TouchDesigner.
+ LinearChaos (aka "LinearChaos A") is the first real iteration of the system
+ LinearChaos B was started when I ported LinearChaos from TouchDesigner v077 to the v088 beta. It then expanded and changed in a number of new directions.
+ prototype and LinearChaosController were part of a tangent that I went on for a while related to MIDI control processing. Most of it got merged into LinearChaosB and subsequently abandoned.
+ LinearChaos C is the latest iteration which really should have been named something else because it was completely rewritten. It has a totally different rendering system with different geometries and processing. Basically the only things that it inherited from the earlier iterations are its internal structure and control systems.
