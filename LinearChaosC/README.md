LinearChaosC
===========

Linearchaos is a visual performance system, built with TouchDesigner.
This series has gone through several iterations. This is the third and latest (main) iteration.
It really should have been named something else because it was completely rewritten. It has a totally different rendering system with different geometries and processing. Basically the only things that it inherited from the earlier iterations are its internal structure and control systems.
